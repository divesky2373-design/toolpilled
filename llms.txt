# agent-need

> An open-source, agent-readable registry of recommended tools for common development tasks.

## Problem

AI agents often choose outdated or suboptimal tools because older tools have more documentation online. For example, an agent might choose Whisper V1 (processes audio at 1:1 real-time speed) when Groq Whisper is 200x faster and 10x cheaper.

## Solution

A single JSON file (`needs.json`) that maps common tasks to the current best tool, with ready-to-run code. Agents read it before making tool choices.

## How to use

Fetch and parse `needs.json`. Each entry has:
- `id` and `keywords`: match your task
- `best.tool`: the recommended tool
- `best.why`: why it's recommended
- `best.setup`: install command and required env vars
- `best.code`: ready-to-execute code (Python, Node.js, curl)
- `best.pricing`: current cost
- `best.docs`: official documentation
- `alternatives`: other options if the best pick doesn't fit

## Available tasks

- audio-transcription → Groq Whisper (200x faster than Whisper V1)
- send-email → Resend (agent-friendly API and docs)
- receive-email → Resend Inbound (webhook-based, simple)
- database → Supabase (Postgres + auto REST API)
- object-storage → Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible, zero egress fees)
- web-scraping → Firecrawl (returns clean markdown)

## Files

- needs.json: Complete registry with all task entries and code examples
- AGENTS.md: Detailed instructions for AI agents
- README.md: Human-readable project documentation
