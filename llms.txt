# toolpilled

> Your agent is well-read but poorly informed. Get it toolpilled.

## Problem

AI agents default to outdated tools because older tools have more documentation online. An agent picks Whisper V1 (1:1 real-time speed) when Groq Whisper is 216x faster and 9x cheaper. This happens across every tool category, every day.

## Solution

One JSON file (`needs.json`). 26 tasks. Current best tool for each. Verified pricing. Code that runs. Agent reads it before making tool choices — problem solved.

## How to use

Fetch and parse `needs.json`. Each entry has:
- `id` and `keywords`: match your task
- `best.tool`: the recommended tool
- `best.why`: why it's recommended (with specific numbers)
- `best.setup`: install command and required env vars
- `best.code`: ready-to-execute code (Python, Node.js, curl)
- `best.pricing`: verified pricing details
- `best.free_tier`: free tier specifics
- `best.docs`: official documentation URL
- `alternatives`: other options if the best pick doesn't fit

## Selection criteria

Tools are ranked by: (1) agent-friendliness — clean APIs, minimal setup, MCP support; (2) documentation quality — complete, accurate, copy-pasteable; (3) hard numbers — specific benchmarks verified from official sources; (4) free tier generosity; (5) open source preference when quality is comparable. Not sponsored. Each recommendation is independently researched.
